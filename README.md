tic-tac-toe

You can get creative with this one, but there are a couple criteria we are looking for:


	
Please use Java and TDD with JUnit/Mockito - you should have 100% or near-100% test coverage
	The game board must display to the console every turn
	You don't have to make an AI, but you can if you want - at minimum, two human players could sit next to each other and play
	There must be a win condition that ends the game if a player gets 3 in a row

Note that if you make a new Gradle project in IntelliJ, it should automatically give you the dependency for JUnit. We hope you actively engage in the TDD red-green-refactor process, it should make coding easier, not harder!
